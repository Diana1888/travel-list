        destination: "CN Tower",

        description: "One of Canada’s greatest landmarks and one of the seven wonders of the modern world, the CN Tower has come to define the Toronto skyline. At 553 metres in height, this engineering wonder is hard to miss during any trip through the city and you don’t want to miss it. Beyond being a very cool building you can take an elevator up to the revolving 360 Restaurant for world-class dining. Feeling a bit bold? Walk across the glass floor, only 2.5 inches thick, 113 storeys above the ground. Want an even bigger thrill? Travel up another 33 storeys to the Skypod lookout. Still not daring enough? Strap on a harness, head outside, and take a thrilling walk along the building’s edge with nothing but air between you and the ground, in the not-for-the-faint-of-heart EdgeWalk experience. This adrenaline-inducing activity is actually the world’s highest ‘hands-free walk,’ so you can brag about that one to your friends.",

        destination: "Royal Ontario Museum",

        description: "The Royal Ontario Museum is the biggest museum of world cultures and natural history in Canada. Located right in downtown Toronto, the striking main entrance to the museum, known as The Crystal and designed by Michael Lee Chin, will draw you in right away. Inside, the museum houses exhibits that run the gamut from dinosaurs to ancient Egypt to Canada’s First Nations. It’s hard to categorize the, oh, six million-or-so objects the museum has in its collections, but trust us, you’ll be able to find something you really enjoy. As you walk from floor to floor, past the 25-metre totem pole, you’ll encounter art, history, archeology, mineralogy, geology, paleontology, zoology, and elements of any other -ology you could probably imagine! With something new to discover every time you visit, the 100-year-old museum is a favorite of locals and tourists alike.",

        destination: "Ripley’s Aquarium of Canada",

        description: "Do you like the idea of coming face to face with a shark, separated only by a pane of glass? The Ripley’s Aquarium of Canada allows you to live that experience, while exposing you to another 16,000 marine animals hosted on site. It takes 5.7 million litres of water to host all of those animals, from southern stingrays, to 65-year-old giant lobsters, to giant pacific octopus, to nettle jellyfish. Explore life on the reef, walk in safety under a dangerous lagoon, stick your head in an underwater viewing bubble, or take in a stingray dive show. Open 365 days a year, you can always turn to the Ripley’s Aquarium of Canada for an exciting day—whether it’s an angelfish on Christmas Day, or a stingray on your birthday.",

        destination: "Casa Loma",

        description: "Believe it or not, the only full-sized castle in North America is actually located in Toronto. Casa Loma literally has everything you could want from a castle. There are turrets offering beautiful views of the city. There’s a large library and nearly 100 rooms to explore. There are secret passageways to discover, including a 245-metre tunnel to the stables and carriage house, the latter of which features an exhibit of vintage cars from the early 1900’s. Plus it has five acres of gardens full of beautiful flowers, sculptures and fountains. Plug in your headphones, listen to the digital audio guide, and roam around a castle in the city.",

This pedestrian-only village features more than 40 heritage buildings that now house everything a modern traveller might enjoy.
